## Multi-Face-Recognition
In this project, I use MTCNN for face detection and VGG16 for face recognition.

## Description
### Face Recognition (MTCNN)
In the realm of computer vision,Face Recognition serves the pivotal role of distinguishing and validating individuals through digital imagery or video snippets, extensively utilized in security infrastructure, biometric verifications, and social media interfaces.

### Calculate Bounding Box Area (Remove Noise Detection)
For some of the false detections, We filtered out these false detections by calculating the bounding box area.

### Face Recognition (VGG16)
VGG16, crafted by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford, stands as a hallmark in the realm of convolutional neural network architectures introduced by Qassim, H., et al. in their paper **Compressed residual-VGG16 CNN model for big data places image recognition**. 

### Classifying Images with VGG16 Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms
We used to classify with 5 machine learning algorithms for classifiation : Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Neural Network, Gradient Boosting, Nearest Neighbor.

2. Run this file Train.ipynb
```
Run Train.ipynb
```
In this Train.ipynb , There is vgg16 model with 5 machine learning classifiers.
This is performace plot for train and validation accuracy classify with best performance accuracy model (Logistic_Regression).
The second is Linear_SVM and Neural_Network. 
The third is Gradient Boosting. 
Final one is Nearest Neighbor.
